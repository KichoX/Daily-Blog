This is the same as The journal template i did for local use without database but this one hosted and ready for actual use. Btw you can click the footer text to navigate you to my cv if you want to learn more about me.

step by step of the upload:

1. Selecting whole directory in VScode and opening terminal.

2. Using the terminal to push all files to new github repository.

3. The code should be linked with the database in my case Iâ€™m using MongoDB Atlas.

4. On render.com I linked my github repository and I have added a new Enviroment of the port that render should use (my case port 4000).

5. Following some basic steps for the setup and setting which commands it should use I finally managed to host whole app on Web. (for free btw :)
